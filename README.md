# 🌞🌗🌙 **Day Track**

Welcome to **Day Track** – a project where I practice my ✨**JavaVanilla JS**✨ skills along with some spicy 🌶️ CSS styling and 💪 Git magic. It's all about **staying on track** from sunrise to sunset! 🌄

## 🛠️ **What’s Inside?**

### 🌈 **Color Themes**
- **Day Mode**: 🌞 Fresh and bright, like a summer morning! 
- **Evening Mode**: 🌆 Warm hues, just like the golden hour.
- **Night Mode**: 🌚 Dark and cozy, perfect for night owls.

### 💃 **Styling**
- Smooth transitions 🎢, responsive designs 📱, and a fancy GIF logo 🎥 that blends with the background like magic 🪄.

### 🖱️ **Theme Buttons**
- **🌝**: Switch to Day Mode
- **🌗**: Switch to Evening Mode
- **🌚**: Switch to Night Mode
- Press 'em! It’s oddly satisfying. 😌
